# Contributing to treetop-client

Thank you for considering contributing to treetop-client.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Use Rust 1.93.1+ to run the development and test suite (`rustup update stable`).
   Rust 1.93.1 is the minimum for the library and development tooling.
3. Run the local verification baseline below.

## Development workflow

### Before submitting a PR

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets
cargo test --doc
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features
```

Run `cargo test --all-features` after transport, endpoint, or server-facing type changes; it
requires Docker. After dependency or policy changes, also run:

```bash
cargo audit --deny warnings
cargo deny check advisories bans licenses sources
```

Run relevant fuzz targets after changing an untrusted-input boundary, and use
`cargo package --locked` when release or package contents change. All applicable checks must pass.
If an external service or tool is unavailable, state exactly which check remains unverified.

### Code style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- All public items (structs, enums, methods, functions, type aliases) must have doc comments.
- Prefer builder patterns over constructors with many parameters.
- Keep serde attributes wire-compatible with the Treetop REST API.

### Testing

- Unit tests go in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` within the source file.
- Integration tests go in `tests/`.
- Use `wiremock` for HTTP integration tests.
- Test serde round-trips for any new or modified types.
- Add property tests for invariants with broad structured input spaces.
- Add or update a `cargo-fuzz` target for parsers and other untrusted-input boundaries.

The `TREETOP_TEST_IMAGE` environment variable selects the container image used by server tests.
CI runs the full current contract against the immutable REST release image pinned in the workflow.
Historical server matrices are removed; breaking migrations must be documented.

### Wire compatibility

This crate replicates types from `treetop-core` and `treetop-rest` for JSON wire
compatibility. When modifying types:

- Check the exact JSON format against the server's snapshot tests or `docs/api.md`.
- Verify serde round-trip correctness with a test.
- Do not add `#[serde(skip)]` or change field names without confirming the server
  produces the same output.

### Commit messages

- Use imperative mood ("Fix bug" not "Fixed bug").
- Keep the first line under 72 characters.
- Reference issues where applicable.

## Reporting issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.
- Include the treetop-client version, Rust version, and server version if relevant.
- For bugs, include a minimal reproduction case.
